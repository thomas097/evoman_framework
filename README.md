## Task 2 - Generalist Agent

**Pro tip**: Temporarily add ```return``` at the top of all ```draw()``` functions in ```tmx.py``` in the evoman folder (after pulling plees). This will speed up the simulation 8x because it removes the pygame overhead of the game sprites. Make sure to replace the game with a fresh copy of evoman though before submitting the code (!).
